This mini-project was intended to be practice for implementing factory functions and the revealing module pattern.
As the first program in which I divided code and tried to limit spillover into the global namespace, it was somewhat
challenging deciding what pieces of data and behavior should go where. Ultimately, I decided to go with what I felt
was best, accepting that it would probably not be optimal.

While I probably could have made this much faster if I didn't divide code into modules and factory functions, overall,
the process felt a lot "neater," and the organization felt much more logical. I could easily see how bigger programs
could benefit from this organization.

In the future, it might be worthwhile to come back and add an unbeatable AI in, but as that was not what my focus was
on for this mini-project, I chose not to implement it for the time being.
